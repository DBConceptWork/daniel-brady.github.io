I am a CFD engineer, using FDS and OpenFOAM to determine effectiveness of smoke extract systems - I graduated from the University of Central Lancashire with an MEng (Hons) in Aerospace Engineering.

During my third year at university, I conducted comprehensive simulations and analysis to investigate the flow characteristics within a custom-designed rocket nozzle, leveraging the capabilities of ANSYS Fluent. These simulations provided valuable insights into the internal flow properties of the nozzle. In my fourth-year project, I utilised ANSYS Fluent to predict and analyze the aerodynamic properties of a morphing wing.

Along with extensive use of ANSYS Fluent, I also recognized the growing importance of OpenFOAM as a widely used CFD package. To expand my skill set, I independently embarked on learning OpenFOAM and familiarizing myself with its functionalities. I acknowledge the significance of OpenFOAM in the industry and remain committed to enhancing my skills in this area. Furthermore, I have experience with Fire Dynamics Simulator (FDS) to study fire-driven flows.

In addition to my CFD knowledge, I have demonstrated proficiency in utilising Solidworks, ANSYS SpaceClaim, AutoCAD Inventor and Rhino3D for various modeling tasks. I understand making professional looking documents leave excellent impressions for first time readers. I've made extensive use of Overleaf, an online LaTeX editor, to produce high-quality documents.

I believe in the continuous pursuit of knowledge and by combining my experience I have with ANSYS Fluent, OpenFOAM, FDS and programming, I am well-prepared to contribute effectively to any CFD-related projects and embrace challenges that come with CFD.
